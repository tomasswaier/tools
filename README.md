print_random_file tool.

You can just execute trough python3 ./main.py <Directory_name> <action>

Example : python3 ./main.py miku -w 

this will create a miku directory if it doesnt already exist and it will prompt you to paste in your ascii art

python3 ./main.py shrek -r will create shrek directory if it doesnt exist and exit afterwards if there are no files inside of it . If there are files then it will print random .txt file from them
