screenshotting tool you can use with combination of w s a d and h j k l where wsad picks which side you want to change and then j increments it's value and j decrements increments it

if you want to save then you can use x or q to quit

you will need gtk 3.0

This code will try to save the screenshot to /Picutures/Screenshots

you can specify the number of pixels the border should move just by pressing the numbers just like in nvim (123wj will move top border(w) down (j) by 123 pixels)
